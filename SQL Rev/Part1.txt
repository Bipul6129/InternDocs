RDBMS

	RDBMS
	- program that allows to create,update and administer relational database.

	Relational Database
	- type of database that uses structure that allows to identify and access data in relation to another piece of data in the database.


Entity relationship
	is an illustration of various entities in a business and the relationships among them.


Handling NULLS
	
	IFNULL():
		SELECT IFNULL(col_name,'def_value') FROM table;

		- returns value of col_name if it is not null if null then returns def_value

	COALESCE():
		SELECT COALESCE(col1,col2,'def_value') FROM table;

		- returns the value of col1 if not null else checks col2 if both null returns def value

	NVL():
		SELECT NVL(col1,'def_val') FROM table;

		- in sole rdbms such as oracle used same as ifnull





Type Casting
	- conversion of one data type to other

	SELECT CAST(age_col AS INT) FROM table;


Wild Cards
	- used in conjuction with the LIKE opetator to search patterns within text.

	- % represents zero or more characters
	- _ represents a single character
	- [] represents any single character within brackets
	- ^ Represents any character not in the brackets
	- - represents any single character within the specified range

	SELET * FROM col WHERE col_name LIKE 'Jhon%';




Common Function
	
	CHARINDEX
		- SELECT CHARINDEX('abc',col) FROM table;

		- returns the starting pos of the substring 'abc' within the alues of col in table

	SUBSTRING
		- SELECT SUBSTRING(col,4,3) FROM table;

		- returns a substring consisting of three characs starting from fourth in each value

	CONCAT
		- SELECT CONCAT(first_col,' ',second_col) FROM table;

		- concatenates the first and last cols with space between



SET Operators
	SELECT employee_id FROM employees 
	UNION
	SELECT employee_id FROM job_history;

	UNION
	- returns all rows that are selected by either query

	UNION ALL
	- same as UNION but includes all duplicates

	INTERSECT
	- takes the data from both result sets which are in common.

	MINUS
	- returns rows in the first query that are not present in second query



JOINS

	SELECT colname FROM table INNER JOIN table2 ON table.col = table2.col;

	INNER JOIN 
	OUTER JOIN
	- LEFT JOIN
	- RIGHT JOIN
	- FULL JOIN 
	SELF JOIN
	CROSS JOIN
	- xombines each row from first table with each row from the second table
	ANTIJOIN
	- type of join that returns rows from the left table where there is no match on the right table. You can achieve this using NOT EXISTS or NOT IN clause


MERGE
	- It is the combination of three INSERT,DELETE and UPDATE statements.There is a source tabke and target table that needs to be merged then with the help of MERGE statement all three operations can be performed at once.


CTE( common table expressions)
	A temporary named result set that u can reference within a SELECT,UPDATE,INSERT, or DELETE statement.

	We can define CTEs by adding a WITH clause directly before SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE or MERGE statement.


Stored Procedure
	Used to automate the task that requires multiple SQL statements and is performed frequently.


LAG,LEAD


RANK FUNCTIONS
	Rank()
		- Assigns unique rank to each distinct row based on specified col values. Rows with equal rank receive same rank and next rank is skipped.

		SELECT col1, RANK() OVER(ORDER BY col1) AS ranking FROM table;

	DENSE_RANK()
		- similar to RANK() but does not skip rank values for equal rows.

		SELECT col1, RANK() OVER(ORDER BY col1) AS dense_ranking FROM table;

	ROW_NUMBER()
		- assigns a unique number to each row based on the specified column values. Rows with equal values receive different row numbers.

		SELECT col1, ROW_NUMBER() OVER(ORDER BY col1) AS row_number FROM table;
